### Background
Customer Personality Analysis refers to a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It enables a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify the line-up of products according to the specific needs, behaviours and concerns from different groups of customers. For instance, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze and identify the customer segment which is most likely to purchase the product, and craft up marketing campaigns that promote the product only to that particular segment.

### Problem Statement
SweetTreats is a grocery retailer with both online presence and physical stores, selling a variety of products from wine to fruits, meat, fish, sweets and gold. It requires all customers to create an account with the retailer, indicating demographic details such as year of birth, education level, marital status, etc. Purchase transactions (both online and physical) by customers are also recorded in their accounts. Occasionally, SweetTreats sends out marketing communications to selected customers, sharing with them new promotional deals that they can enjoy as members of the retailer. 

To improve revenue, SweetTreats aims to address the following issues: 
- Can the customers of the retailer be segmented into groups for more effective targeting through marketing campaigns? 
- What are some key characteristics of each customer segment?
